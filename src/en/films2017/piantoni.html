            of the Berlin Wall. Main focus of this film is the period before,
            affected by discontent with the outdated political system, hope and
            a sense of impending change. Those who worked in cinema in Dresden
            before 1989, such as former cinema managers, film projectionists,
            cashiers, ushers and caretakers, talk about their experiences. The
            position of those sitting and discussing in the foyer, in the gap
            between fiction on the screen and reality beyond the cinema doors.
            Topics of conversation besides the films were the obsolete political
            system and the utopia of changing the system from within. &nbsp;</span>

          <p><span class="CharOverride-14">The industrial climbing cooperative
              Świetlik was developed from the Solidarność movement in 1980 in
              Gdansk. Świetlik was a community of dissidents working in
              factories throughout Poland under somewhat dangerous conditions.
              They strongly supported the opposition, by distributing leaflets
              amongst the factory workers and by hanging banners with political
              statements on high-rise buildings.<br>
              The film shows a re-enactmentof a typical working situation in an
              industrial setting. In excerpts of interviews, which form the
              audio part of the installation, former Świetlik members are
              talking about their experiences within the company, their support
              of the opposition, the blending of their private and professional
              life and how the past experiences form the basis for their current
              participation in society and politics in Poland.<br>

          <p><span class="CharOverride-14">I usually develop my films on the
              basis of interviews together with moving images and re-enactments
              of past events. For an exhibition at the stonemason’s cooperative
              in Porto, I continued to research about worker‘s communities,
              focusing on the worker‘s traditional songs and the sound of the
              working process. Do the traditional songs still exist which
              reflect the monotony of the work, but also help to perform it? In
              what other way sound / rhythm / music plays a role at work?<br>
              Besides the masons, I was interested in the background and culture
              of the students of the school which is now located in the building
              of the cooperative. I connected the young generation of the
              students with the older generation of the masons who are working
              at the factory and are aware of the history.<br>

            The group 22 Ottobre or Terzo Radio GAP was founded in October 1969
            in Genoa, the city with very strong resistance by partisans against
            the German occupation during World War II. Radio GAP was the first
            group taking part at the armed struggle ‚lotta armata’ (armed
            struggle). The name ‚Gruppi d’Azione Partigiana’ refers to the
            history of the partisans and at the same time uses a contemporary
            medium of communication: the television. Other groups such as the
            Brigate Rosse informed about their actions with leaflets. Radio GAP
            directly brought the information to the public, in their
            livingrooms. After the news, during the advertising, their messages
            interrupted the programme’s sound. They choose a strategy of
            propaganda similar to an artistic action, a communication guerrilla,
            as in the Situationist movement happening at the same time in Paris.</div>
