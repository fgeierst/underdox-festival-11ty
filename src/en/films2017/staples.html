A bee suckles at a sweet pea bloom like a baby on a              breast. Runner bean shoots sway and twirl as gracefully as              dancers. It is difficult to put into words the alien strangeness              of the microscopic worlds depicted by the pioneering filmmaker F.              Percy Smith. Self-taught and working before and after the first              world <br>              war, Smith mastered early microscopic, time-lapse and underwater              photography with contraptions he fashioned from Meccano,              candlewicks and gramophone needles. Stuart Staples, the lead              singer and creative force behind the indie band Tindersticks, was              so entranced by Smith’s work that he made a film. MINUTE BODIES is              a beautiful,<br>              hypnotic melange of the amazing footage Smith captured at his              suburban home on the edge of London. Rather than interpret the              pictures with voiceover or subtitles, Staples and film editor              David Reeve have intricately matched the images with an              instrumental score, which is sometimes soothing and often              sinister.

Staples&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>* 1965. Staples is            the lead singer of Tindersticks, an originally Nottingham-based band            formed in late 1991. Initially called Asphalt Ribbons, the band            changed their name after Staples found a box of German matches on a            beach in Greece. Between them they’ve scored five Denis films, with            Tindersticks doing Nénette and Boni, Trouble Every Day and 35 Shots            of Rum, while Hinchliffe scored Vendredi Soir and Staples did The            Intruder.<strong><br>              <br>              F. Percy Smith</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; (1880–1945)&nbsp; * in London            in 1880. He was keen to exploit the educational possibilities of            film, but employment at the Board of Education offered little            opportunity, and he began working for the film entrepreneur Charles            Urban, who had been impressed with his photograph of a bluebottle's            tongue. During the First World War, Smith made a series of films            depicting battles through animated maps and worked as a Naval            photographer. When the war was over he turned to comedy with The            Bedtime Stories of Archie the Ant (1925), featuring insect            characters in a natural environment, but his real love was the            'Secrets of Nature' series he made for British Instructional Films.            Beginning in 1922, the series continued into the '30s, when it            became 'Secrets of Life', and thrived until Smith's death in 1945.            Technological changes such as the coming of sound were easily            absorbed - commentary worked equally well as inter-titles or spoken            words and Smith's films fascinated successive generations just as            David Attenborough's wildlife documentaries have on television.<br>            <br>            Smith was a true pioneer, inventing original (and bizarre) methods            for time lapse and micro cinematography, involving all kinds of            home-made devices, including alarms all over his home to wake him up            in the middle of the night if the film in the camera needed            changing. With endless patience, he could spend up to two and a half            years to complete a film. He also had the popular touch, with the            happy knack (as he put it himself) of being able to feed his            audience "the powder of instruction in the jam of entertainment".            Modern film technique could hardly better the results achieved by            Smith in the first decades of the century and his early masterpiece            Birth of a Flower (1910) has never been out of distribution. In the            '30s Smith tended to rely on his colleagues, Mary Field and H.R            Hewer, to direct, while he concentrated on his painstaking            photography. He died at his home in Southgate, North London, on 24            March 1945.<br>            <br>            <strong>Films</strong> &nbsp; To Demonstrate How Spiders Fly 1909 –            The Acrobatic Fly 1910 – The Birth of a Flower 1910 Fight for the            Dardanelles 1915 – ab 1922 Secrets of Nature Series, darunter The            Bedtime Stories of Archie the Ant 1925 – The World in a Wine-Glass            1931<strong></strong></div>          <strong>            <!--! end of .info --></strong></div>        <!--! end of #main-content --> </div>      <!--! end of #main -->      <div id="footer"> <a href="http://underdox-festival.de/">home</a> | <a href="../impressum.htm">imprint</a>        | <a href="../../de/filme.htm">deutsch</a> | © UNDERDOX 2006-2017</div>      <!--! end of #footer --> </div>    <!--! end of #container -->  </body></html>
