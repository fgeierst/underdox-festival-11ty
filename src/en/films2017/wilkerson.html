          <p class="Einf--Abs-"><span class="CharOverride-14">Wilkerson narrates
              the story of two families, one white and one black, and it’s one
              hell of a story. The filmmaker’s great-grandfather, S.E.Branch,
              shot a man named Bill Spann one Alabama night in 1946. Although he
              was charged with murder, Branch never served a day in prison.
              Wilkerson frames his masterful film as a murder-mystery<br>
              investigation into this family secret, returning to his hometown
              for the first time in 20 years to uncover the truth. On the way,
              the road diverts – clearly, it’s not a detour – to an oral history
              of southern racism, amounting to a ghost chronicle of haunted
              places where time has stood still.<br>
              Radical filmmaking demands radical aesthetics, and Wilkerson,
              delivering the angry voiceover himself, mostly films his
              landscapes and interview scenes in stark black and white,
              deviating for lengthy travelling shots painted in red, camera
              pointed out the front window of his car, as he drives the Alabama
              highways on a search that comes to threaten his own safety.
              Spann’s life and death is shown to be atypical among southern
              blacks in the 1940s, but as with all good historical inquiries,
              Wilkerson’s point is in the here and now. As young blacks are
              gunned down by police without incrimination on a<br>
              frequent basis, Wilkerson’s incredibly powerful film speaks
              volumes to the present, and demands that we never forget. (Mark
              Peranson)<strong> </strong></span><span class="CharOverride-14"></span></p>

          <div class="info"><strong>Travis Wilkerson</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; * 1969
            in Denver, USA.
            <meta charset="utf-8">
            American independent film director, screenwriter, producer and
            performance artist. Named the "political conscience of 21st century
            American independent cinema," by Sight &amp; Sound Magazine,
            Wilkerson is heavily influenced by the Third Cinema movement, and
            known for films that combine "maximalist aesthetics and radical
            politics." This is owed, in part, to his meeting Cuban filmmaker
            Santiago Álvarez. Following the meeting, Wilkerson made the feature
            documentary Accelerated Under-Development about that meeting, and he
            was heavily involved in the rediscovery of Alvarez's films.<br>
