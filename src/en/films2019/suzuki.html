          Associated for many years with the Alentejo region, they turned two
          mounds for burning charcoal on the shore of a lake near Mértola into
          the main protagonists of The Earth. However, this is not a classic <br>
          documentary about “beautiful work,” about a craft fading into
          obscurity. The observation of the material world in this case is not
          so much a pretext for a story about the people and the history of
          these places as it is a way of creating a form that is spectacular in
          its minimalism. <br>
          The experience of cinema is beyond words, reason the filmmakers. <br>
          Thus, what we are dealing with in their film is the nature of an <br>
          alchemical process that is full of mysterious gestures. We wanted to
          provoke viewers into feeling what we ourselves felt in contact with
          the basic elements of the world that surrounds us: water, fire, air,
          earth, space. The result is a film that is like incense, shrouded in
          smoke that purifies and beautifies. The rhythm of the film is tuned to
          the rhythm of this particular place on Earth, which will move you and
          give you strength, no matter where you come from. (Agnieszka Szeffel –
          New Horizons) <br>
