The works are mostly presented digitally and show          the spectrum of media possibilities. <br>          <br>          Installations and a live performance add analogue haptic presence to          the ephemerality of the digital artworks. Participation in the          exhibition is on an open call for entry. <br>          The selected works compete for the VIDEODOX Award, endowed with&nbsp;          1000 € and&nbsp; donated by B.O.A. Videofilmkunst (Peider Defilla).<br>          <br>          Up to 15 works will be presented which deal in a special way with the          cinematic aspects of video art. The works will be selected by an          interdisciplinary gender-balanced committee.<br>          <br>          Participants of the exposition should have a relationship with          Bavaria, while living or working there or having produced the          presented work in Bavaria. It isn't necessary though that they still          live in Bavaria.<br>          <br>          An independent jury of experts selects the Award winner.<br>          <br>          <strong>VIDEODOX Award 2019 at Gallery of the Artists</strong><br>          Maximilianstr.&nbsp; 42, 80538 Munich<br>          9 – 20 oct 2019, daily 11 a.m.- 6 p.m.<br>          Opening 9 oct 2019<br>          Award ceremony and video performance 13 okt 2019<br>          <br>          <strong>Deadline of submission: 15 june 2019<br>            <br>          </strong>          <h2>VIDEODOX Award 2019 </h2>          <p><strong>The VIDEODOX Award 2019 is donated by Peider A.

In 2015, the festival, in cooperation with            BBK e.V., decided to present video art in an independent exhibition            and founded VIDEODOX as the festival's only award-winning section.            The prize was set up to promote the still young art form and is            therefore not a prize for young talent aimed exclusively at young            artists. <br>            Since then, the biennial exhibition VIDEODOX presents video art from            Bavaria in the spacious historical rooms of the Galerie der            Künstler.</p>          <strong>You can find an overview of our video art exhibitions in our <a              href="archive.htm">archive</a>.</strong><br>        </div>        <!--! end of #main-content --> </div>      <!--! end of #main -->      <div id="footer"> <a href="http://underdox-festival.de/">home</a> | <a href="impressum.htm">impressum</a>        | <a href="../de/videos.htm">deutsch</a> | © UNDERDOX 2006-2019</div>      <!--! end of #footer --> </div>    <!--! end of #container -->  </body></html>
