                    Thomas Heise</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (*1955 in Berlin,
                  GDR), writer, documentary filmmaker and theater director,
                  became known as a chronicler of the German-German
                  reunification. Among his essayistic documentaries are
                  snapshots that capture the controversial political mood of the
                  reunited country (DER IMBISS 1990, STAU 1992), and large
                  oeuvres that, in an unmistakable style, connect the present
                  with political states of German history (VATERLAND 2002) or
                  contemporary history with the cultural life of GDR (MATERIAL
                  2009). Even with his early work WOZU DENN ÜBER DIESE LEUTE
                  EINEN FILM? (1980), which he realized during his (abondend)
                  studies at the HFF Potsdam, Heise demonstrated a feeling for
                  underrepresented realities and hidden narratives. <br>

          <p>HEIMAT IS A SPACE OF TIME is a monumental maelstrom of memory
            reminiscent of Victor Klemperer's diaries, dating back to before the
            First World War. In letters, the genealogy of the filmmaker's family
            is traced against the background of political events and the
            cultural and spiritual life of the GDR.</p>

                of a New Tomorrow</a> – by Daniel Kasman, Mubi</strong></p>
          <p>Thomas Heise’s <em>Heimat Is a Space in Time</em> is majestic
            essay film whose scope is national and historical but whose address
            is deeply personal. The film tells the 20th century family history
            of the director through letters and diary entries. These remarkable
            documents, deeply evocative and wonderfully written, narrate in
            their own way the 20th century history of Germany, starting before
            the First World War and moving into the economic catastrophe of
            Weimar Republic, the increasingly terrifying and oppressive policies
            under the Nazis, and then segueing into life in East Germany, where
            Heise’s father was a notable philosopher. </p>
          <p> These convulsive historical epochs breath in every word of the
            correspondence and entries that Heise himself reads, but the first
            encounter with the texts are individual first and foremost. They
            tell of love (and love affairs), of the yearning for family across
            borders (some family members are in Vienna while others are in
            Germany), of fear, of socialist ideals, of children—in short, of the
            whole gamut of human life on the personal level, emotive, dramatic,
            confessional, posturing, placating, and brutally honest.<br>
            To accompany these texts, Heise has chosen an austere but potent
            black and white palette which grants a haunting monumentality to his
            images. </p>
          <p>His camera sometimes visits current-day German streets and metros,
            teeming with life seemingly so removed from the previous century.
            Sometimes he visits site referenced in the letters, old work camps
            and factories; or we see photos of family members whose long texts
            are heard. &nbsp;A long, devastating stretch is devoted to scrolling
            through a list of names and addresses circa 1942 as we hear
            increasingly desolate and fearful letters from to Vienna about
            deportations of Jews to Poland. The specific location of other
            images are less clear, landscapes and ruptured highways, but the
            point is always exact: Heise’s eye considers his country now, after
            the reunification, as he through his family’s records traces how it
            came to this place. </p>
          <p>Despite its modest means, the scope of the film is immense and its
            insights and peculiarities found in its epistolary revelation vast.
            It is an essential film of essential inquiry, one that looks into
            what is most close to its maker and finds people and stories that
            tell their own tale and through them something even bigger.</p>
