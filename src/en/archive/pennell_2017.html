          <h2>I. choreographies of presence (1995-2007)</h2>
          <br>
          British artist Miranda Pennell (b. in 1963 in London) studied
          Contemporary Dance in New York and Amsterdam and later Visual
          Anthropology in London. Both sides, the performing body and
          theoretical ideas, come togehter in her films, shaping reality as
          phenomenons of social habits. Such Pennell's work has circled around
          ritual performance from two directions: cultural play, particularly by
          teenagers, who drum (DRUM ROOM, 2007), dance (YOU MADE ME LOVE YOU,
          2005) and skate (MAGNETIC NORTH, 2003) across her shorts; and in
          rehearsals of violence, both formal and informal, in the military
          drill of TATTOO (2001) and the Western bar brawl-meets-football
          casuals punch-up of FISTICUFFS (2004).<br>
          <br>

          &nbsp;<br>
          <h2>II. film as an archive (from 2010)</h2>
          <br>
          These flocking formations of human behaviour have both informed and
          transmuted her more recent practice, which involves deep researchinto
          archival images of British colonialism. Her performative ethnography
          of white British/European culture – its weekend fights and secret
          art-making –hones her close observation in WHY COLONEL BUNNY WAS
          KILLED (2010). Obsessively re-reading a photograph captioned, the
          filmelicits thoughtful parallels between the late 19th-century British
          presence on India's North West frontier and the 21st-century illegal
          invasion ofAfghanistan and its impact on the same area. The archival
          footage takes the place of the performances Pennell staged and filmed
          in previous work, offeringan equal – and equally telling –
          historiographic, and even psychoanalytic, insights into gestural and
          cultural repetition.<br>
          <br>

          &nbsp;<br>
          COLONEL BUNNY and Pennell's first feature THE HOST (2015) form
          something of a diptych, not only in their use of archival material,
          but in the location of that archival material in response to Pennell's
          own family history, and her desire to interrogate and interrupt the
          repetition of colonialism through the generations. In revealing the
          process of using family materials, the films take a position that is
          at once subjective and intimate; enabled by this, they also speak more
          generally (and generatively) of a shared colonial past that continues
          its effects in the present.<br>
          UNDERDOX half-time presents a selection from her cinematographic work
          as well as her two recent films.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Miranda Pennell will attend the festival and present her work
            within a film lecture. <br>
            Thursday, June 8th, 7 p.m., Filmmuseum München</strong><br>
