                  Eve Heller</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp; (*1961), a US filmmaker
                with dual citizenship based in Austria since 2005 – who can
                boast teachers including Paul Sharits, Tony Conrad, Keith
                Sanborn, Peter Hutton, Peggy Ahwesh and Abigail Child – has
                remained true to analog (and occasionally hand-processed)
                film. Using a JK optical printer she imported to Austria,
                Heller penetrates found footage frame by frame, enlarging the
                details of images – at times to extremes bordering on
                abstraction. Through her painstaking editing of slowed-down
                imagery and layers of multiple images, Heller
                re-contextualizes the visual vocabulary of her source
                material, rendering dreamlike atmospheres that distill
                entirely new poetic and narrative implications while making
                palpable the materiality of her 16mm medium. <br>
                When she workes without the aid of the printer, hacking
                directly into the film material and editing the material into
                brief fragments, Heller divorces the intended marriage of
                sound and picture, revealing its illusion by breaking down and
                reshuffling the elements, in a manner reminiscent of William
                Burrough’s cut-up technique. She thereby materially generates
                a rhythmical poetry teetering on the borderline between sense
                and nonsense. It makes yet a deeper and different kind of
                sense that the daughter of a refugee from Nazi Austria, upon
                moving back to her father’s native Vienna, presents her films
                for the first time in her mother’s native town, Munich.<br>

                  Peter Tscherkassky</strong> &nbsp; One of the special
                pleasures of working with found footage lies in the creation
                of entirely new stories distilled from "found" images. But for
                me, no less important is my physical contact with the film
                material itself. In a certain sense, I see myself as a kind of
                sculptor when working with analog found footage. I take the
                raw material in hand – literally and figuratively grasping it
                – to shape new images and forms from the admittedly thin but
                nonetheless corporeal strip of film: I sculpt with light in a
                darkroom using various lasers, flashlights and mattes to
                assemble collages from a great variety of sources which I
                contact print onto raw stock. In the process, I try to make
                the unique corporeality of the film strip visible – as a
                sequence of static individual images, with its emulsion, its
                boundaries, its vertical arrangement, the perforations, the
                stripe of the optical soundtrack, dust particles, scratches,
                dents, etc. <br>
                Later, when the completed film is projected, the big screen
                plays host to a two-dimensional sculpture of time, distilled
                in the darkroom to such a degree that the viewer who is open
                can experience it physically: as if the body of the film might
                directly electrify the body of the public. This is what I call
                "physical cinema", and it is this sensorial experience of
                watching film that I consider one of its most elemental
                aspects ¬– in addition to its content, its "story". And it is
                what the cinema is all about: an irreplaceable site for film
                to be experienced as a radical art-form. (Peter Tscherkassky,
                transl. by Eve Heller)<br>

                  Phil Solomon &nbsp;</strong> (1954 – 2019) was an
                internationally recognized filmmaker and has been teaching
                both film history/aesthetics and film production at CU since
                1991. Solomon's work has been screened in every major venue
                for experimental film throughout the U.S. and Europe,
                including the Museum of Modern Art and two Whitney Biennials.
                Solomon's films have won ten first prize awards at major
                international film festivals for experimental film. His films
                reside in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern
                Art, Massachusetts College of Art, Binghamton University,
                Hampshire College, The Chicago Art Institute, San Francisco
                State University, and the Oberhausen Film Collection. Solomon
                collaborated on three films with his colleague and friend,
                Stan Brakhage, who named Solomon's “Remains to be Seen” on his
                Top Ten Films of All Time for “Sight and Sound”. In 2007, Phil
                Solomon embarked on an award winning series of digital videos
                culled from the video game “Grand Theft Auto” entitled “In
                Memoriam, Mark Lapore”, which was named in the Top Ten
                experimental films of the year by the “Village Voice”. </td>
