            UNDERDOX – documents and experiments</h2>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm" lang="en">UNDERDOX is: meeting the
            changing states of documentary evidence, in feature film, video art
            and documentary itself. It isn't a matter of documenting reality, it
            is the matter of experimenting "film" on the pitch of reality.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm" lang="en">UNDERDOX has been founded in
            2006 by film critic Dunja Bialas and theater operator and film
            collector Bernd Brehmer (Werkstattkino). The international film
            festival for documents and experiments shows cross-over works
            putting together the different genres of documentary and
            experimental film, fiction and artistic film. Since 2014 the
            biennial competition VIDEODOX shows a selection of German video art
            (award: 1000 euros).</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm" lang="en">Submissions to all the
            sections (feature films, artist in focus, focus on a film country,
            lost &amp; found, short experimental programme, short documentary
            programme) can be done informally on sending an online link of the
            submitted film to <a href="mailto:info@underdox-festival.de">info@underdox-festival.de</a>,
            including some words why would you think your film would fit to the
            UNDERDOX festival.</p>
          <br>
          <h2 style=" margin-bottom: 0cm" lang="en">manifesto</h2>
          1. We show equally documentary, experimental, essay and fiction films
          and their conceivable intermediate forms.<br>
          <br>
          2. We project movies in their original format. 16mm, 35mm and digital
          formats are equally welcome. We don't prefer any cinematic format or
          would exclude any movie because of its screening format.<br>
          <br>
          3. We embrace overlong feature films. In times where television series
          are presented at film festivals as if they contribute as a cinematic
          format, the original cinematographic long form applies to us as a
          committed statement for our program.<br>
          <br>
          4. We don't care about film competitions. We however care about the
          internal architecture and dialogue developed by the compiled film
          program. Lines of flight, branches, junctions and echoes act on the
          single film as a reinforcer of its art form.<br>
          <br>
          5. External parameters are not crucial to the programming. Relevance,
          production country, film length, big names are in themselves no
          criteria.<br>
          <br>
          6. It is not about getting the biggest audience (and continously
          growing), nor about "industry". Important is to present the chosen
          films to an open minded audience. Our programming contains the
          propositions for a different cinematography.<br>
          <br>
          7. Festivals need multilaterality. Festivals invite films to be shown
          to a new audience, on the other hand festivals would be obsolete if
          the filmmakers wouldn‘t participate. Neither the production or world
          sales companies, film directors nor the festival people should
          therefore exploit the other side. We pay screening fees within
          reasonable bounds of our low budget and expect the World Sales
          Companies to comply with our requests.<br>
          <br>
          8. We have a strict door policy. We select the movies on the big
          screen, either at festivals or together at our programming meetings.
          The films are selected by a committee consisting of filmmakers, cinema
          <br>
          operators or film critics.<br>
          <br>
          9. We practice the freedom of showing films that already premiered
          outside of Munich. <br>
          <br>
          10. We are no mavericks. We maintain partnerships and friendship to
          other festivals with a similar program philosophy. We are in exchange
          with the Viennale, the International Film Festival Rotterdam, the
          Festival of Marseille, the Forum of Berlinale, with Bildrausch in
          Basel, and the Nuremberg Human Rights Film Festival.
