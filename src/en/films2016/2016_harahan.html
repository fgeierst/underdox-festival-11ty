          <span class="betont"></span>Seamus Harahan's video, installation, film
          and sound based practice engages directly with place. His starting
          point is not the making of art; instead his strategy is to forget and
          just film the social and cultural environment around him. Harahan uses
          his video camera - a relatively accessible and moderately affordable
          technology - to take hand-held, seemingly amateur footage, the
          contents of this footage, locating himself and locating others,
          through found activity occurring around him. The main subject is often
          the urban environment, its incidental detail and fugitive nature.
          Music is a vital element in all of Harahan's works, with songs used as
          soundtracks or informing the composition, title or duration of
          individual pieces. The artist takes songs from an eclectic range of
          sources, including reggae and hip hop as well as English and Irish
          traditional music.<br>
          <p> Harahan was a director of Catalyst Arts Belfast from 1996-98. His
            work was featured in Assembly, A survey of Recent Artists' Flms and
            Video in Britain 2008-13 at Tate Britain, London. Cold Open received
            the Jury Award at Ann Arbor Film Festival, Michigan, in 2014. He
            represented Northern Ireland in the 51st Venice Biennale in 2005 and
            received a Paul Hamlyn Award for Artists in 2009. He was artist in
            residence at Centre Culturel Irlandais, Paris, in spring 2015. He
            lives and works in Belfast and is represented in London by Gimpel
            Fils.</p>
          <p>Seamus Harahan was born in 1968 London and raised in Belfast where
            he is living. Winner of the 2015 Jarman Award.</p>
